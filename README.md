A User Authentication Tool Based On Behavioral Biometrics
                      
Behavioral biometrics has emerged as a promising solution to address the limitations of traditional authentication methods. By leveraging the unique behavior patterns exhibited by individuals, such as keystroke dynamics, behavioral biometrics offers a new dimension of authentication that enhances security and accuracy. 
This project presents a software that uses Keystroke dynamics to provide secure authentication, without compromising the user experience. The software captures user keystroke dynamics,specifically Records three features: Hold time – time between press and release of a key, Keydown-Keydown time – time between the pressing of consecutive keys.
Keyup-Keydown time – time between the release of one key and the press of next key, whilst users enters their details.Keystroke dynamics are gathered passively with existing hardware, such as a keyboard. Then, measurable patterns generated from keystroke dynamics are processed using a machine learning algorithm specifically MLP classifier  to generate a uniquely identifying model for the user. The model can be tested subsequently with KMT dynamics input from the same and/or other user(s) and authentication is either approved or denied.
